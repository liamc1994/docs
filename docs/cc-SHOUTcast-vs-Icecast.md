title: "SHOUTcast vs Icecast"

---

We strongly suggest using Icecast. SHOUTcast has stopped their offering of ther DNAS as free software and has released a paid version that will cost 9.90 USD (per station) for features already offered by Icecast and Centova Cast for free. The free version of SHOUTcast can only broadcast one 128kbps stream where before more and no bitrate limit was offered for free. Existing SHOUTcast clients will stay on the old free version with all features.

SHOUTca.st suggests supporting free and open source software by using Cast or Icecast.

## Do I need an MP3 key for SHOUTcast?

MP3 keys were only needed in the past with sc_trans (TRANScast). This software is not developed anymore therefore we replaced it with Liquidsoap a more modern software which doesn't require an MP3 key. 
Furthermore MP3 keys are not being sold anymore, any company trying to sell them to you is technically doing illegal business.

## Can I have SHOUTcast v1?

SHOUTcast v1 has not been updated for over 11 years and never will. Also there are many bugs and even serious security vulnerabilities know to be in there. Therefore we decided to not offer SHOUTcast v1 servers anymore.
SHOUTcast.com also decided to stop supporting SHOUTcast v1 for their directory. Very soon these servers won't be listed anymore.
On top of that the latest versions of Webkit (used in Chrome, Safari, Opera and many more) stopped to support SHOUTcast v1 servers which makes it unable to play SHOUTcast v1 stations in most modern browsers. For this reason SHOUTcast.com has decided to unlist all SHOUTcast v1 servers from their website rendering SHOUTcast v1 useless.
