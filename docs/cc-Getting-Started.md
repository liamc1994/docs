## Getting Started

Welcome to the SHOUTca.st family! New to Centova Cast? Don't worry we all were once! 

First of all we have to find it, [this can help you a lot!](https://docs.shoutca.st/docs/cc-Getting-Started.html#where-to-find-centova-cast)

The first question I have to ask is if you want to use the AutoDJ or not?

*First I'll explain on how to broadcast live only:*
First make sure your server is turned on:
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.20.17.png](https://i.imgur.com/6lY7EX1.png) 
Then go to "Quick Links" and use the details under **"autoDJ is not running"** to connect:

That's all folks! Happy Streaming!

**If you want to use the AutoDJ, pick up here!**
First make sure it is enabled, [you can find instructions on that here.](https://docs.shoutca.st/docs/cc-Getting-Started.html#where-is-the-autodj)
While we are in settings you can change some basic settings
Under Stream:

Some servers might also require your stream name to be changed under Mount Points:
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.29.22.png](https://i.imgur.com/cZSEAFk.png) 
Press update and there we go!

Okay now our settings are correct we can go on.
First of all we have to upload songs!
Open "Files"![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.33.32.png](https://i.imgur.com/tNLtiVI.png)
If you prefer FTP, those details are under "Quick Links".
Make sure you are in the folder "Media"
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.34.33.png](https://i.imgur.com/PgvzP0y.png) 
Press upload:
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.34.57.png](https://i.imgur.com/l0ty7Is.png)

And wait till it is finished...
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.37.03.png](https://i.imgur.com/mecxJKu.png) 
 Now this is done we can close the upload dialog and press return to go back. 

Now we need to go to Media to add the songs to our playlists:
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.38.24.png](https://i.imgur.com/Oc1NVlq.png) 
Select the songs you like and drag them to one of the playlists on the left hand side.
![Schermafbeelding 2015-06-12 om 21.40.36.png](https://i.imgur.com/zs1tlHM.png) 
By default we have 3 rotations, the more heavy the more it will play that song. 
Press return and prepare for the magic moment!
Press start and there we go!

**What's next?**
Now we are streaming it is time to dive into Centova Cast.
If you want to connect live you can find your details under "Quick Links", if your server supports DJ accounts (all types except SHOUTcast v1) you don't even have to turn off the AutoDJ to go live. 
Got a website? Then "Widgets" might be a nice page for you! 
Want to plan in shows? Different rotations? Then the playlists feature is what you are looking for!
Last but not least: freaked on statistics? Yes Centova provides those too! (Even in Excel for the die hards)

## How to broadcast live

Got your broadcasting software and you are ready to go live? Then you probably need the details to connect. Finding them in Centova Cast is pretty simple!

Once logged in, you can find all these details under "Quick Links".

![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-06 om 21.06.42.png](https://i.imgur.com/aXD31kU.png) 

On a recently created server, your details will look like these:

![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-06 om 21.07.27.png](https://i.imgur.com/9WeMvM8.png) 


There are a few things to keep in mind.

First of all **the connection details are different depending on whether AutoDJ is turned on or off.**

My AutoDJ is turned off.
-------------------------------
You can find your info under the "Use this if you do not use the AutoDJ" part. *Please note that DJ accounts will not work for you as the AutoDJ system is turned off.*

Make sure you are using the source password, which is different from the admin password (used to log in to the control panel) by default.

My AutoDJ is turned on.
-------------------------------
When using the AutoDJ system, you need to create a DJ account first; this is an individual account for each DJ. You can permit them to broadcast on certain times and give them limited access to Centova Cast. 

You can create one under "DJs". A detailed guide on that can be found [here](https://docs.shoutca.st/v1.0/docs/getting-started-1#where-is-the-autodj)

To connect the DJ, **do NOT turn off the AutoDJ**, the system will do that for you. Just make sure to use the **first details listed on the "Quick Links" page.**

The **password** of the account needs to be in the **username:password format**.
(eg. I created the DJ named james with password m123, then the password for the encoder needs to be "james:m123")

Known issues and how to solve them
----------------------------------------------

*− It says my password is wrong*

First of all, make sure the password is correct and in the correct format. Also make sure that the DJ is allowed to go live on the current time. If that does not work, please try to restart your server. If it _still_ won't work, feel free to opeen a ticket so we can have a look for you.

*− The software connects for some time then disconnects*

This often means the AutoDJ is not able to read your audio stream. Please ensure that **all** of the following statements are true:

* You are streaming in stereo
* You are using the default sample rate, i.e., 44100Hz (44.1KHz)

## Where is the AutoDJ?

Is the AutoDJ missing in the menu? It is probably just turned off. In this guide I'll explain on how to turn in on in a few simple steps.![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-05 om 15.56.38.png](https://i.imgur.com/0azYVP9.png) 

1) Make sure the server is **turned off**
    You can do that by pressing stop.![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-05 om 15.58.33.png](https://i.imgur.com/Zq0Pdce.png) 

2) Go to your settings. 
![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-05 om 15.59.09.png](https://i.imgur.com/XoHBzLE.png) 
And then go to the tab **AutoDJ**
![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-05 om 15.59.13.png](https://i.imgur.com/zimMpxh.png) 
There make sure it is enabled![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-05 om 16.00.32.png](https://i.imgur.com/qIrIdr4.png) 
When you're done just press **update**
![Schermafbeelding 2015-04-05 om 16.00.35.png](https://i.imgur.com/Nvg0DpM.png)

## Centova Cast keeps rejecting my password

Centova Cast has a security feature that it will block your IP for one hour after too many failed login attempts. If this is the case you will see the error message: "Too many failed login attempts; please try again later."
