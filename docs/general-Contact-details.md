## What is the best way to contact SHOUTca.st?

The best way is to submit a [support ticket](https://my.shoutca.st/submitticket.php). This allows us to view your account details to help you out as fast as possible. Once sent it will be queued up for our support team to answer.

## Do you have a contact number?

We don't, sadly! We used to but unfortunately we had to retire it due to abuse of the service.


## I've got an urgent issue! What should I do?

Via support ticket is the best way. Give us a buzz via Twitter too, but don't tweet any personal information! 
> We've previously had people trying to contact our staff via their personal social media accounts. Just to let you know, this isn't acceptable!
